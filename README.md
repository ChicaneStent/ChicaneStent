I'm an aspiring data analyst with a growing interest in finding insights and stories in data.

I come from a background in admin, reporting, and education, where I’ve worked with spreadsheets, handled data, and helped improve how information is used in day-to-day operations. I’ve recently completed training in Excel, statistics, and data tools like Google Analytics and Looker Studio, and I’m excited to keep learning.
